# 🎯 Core Technical Stack Mastery
## 1. Node.js & TypeScript Fundamentals
typescript
// Must master these concepts:
- Advanced TypeScript (Generics, Utility Types, Decorators)
- Async/Await patterns and error handling
- Event Loop and Node.js architecture
- Module systems (CommonJS vs ES6)
2. Express.js Deep Knowledge
javascript
// Key interview topics:
- Middleware architecture and custom middleware
- Routing and route parameters
- Error handling middleware patterns
- Request/Response lifecycle
- Security best practices (Helmet, CORS, Rate Limiting)
3. MongoDB & Mongoose ODM
javascript
// Essential MongoDB concepts:
- Schema design and data modeling
- Aggregation pipeline
- Indexing and query optimization
- Transactions and ACID properties
- Mongoose middleware (pre/post hooks)
- Population and references vs embedding
4. Authentication & Security
typescript
// Critical security knowledge:
- JWT tokens (access/refresh token flow)
- Password hashing (bcrypt with proper salt rounds)
- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- API security best practices
- SQL/NoSQL injection prevention
- XSS and CSRF protection
🔐 Advanced Authentication Patterns to Implement
1. Refresh Token Rotation
typescript
// Important for security
export class TokenService {
  static async rotateRefreshToken(oldRefreshToken: string): Promise<AuthTokens> {
    // Implement token rotation to prevent replay attacks
  }
}
2. Rate Limiting
typescript
import rateLimit from 'express-rate-limit';

export const authLimiter = rateLimit({
  windowMs: 15 * 60 * 1000, // 15 minutes
  max: 5, // Limit each IP to 5 requests per windowMs
  message: 'Too many authentication attempts, please try again later.'
});
3. Input Validation & Sanitization
typescript
import { body } from 'express-validator';

export const validateUserInput = [
  body('email').isEmail().normalizeEmail(),
  body('password').isStrongPassword({
    minLength: 8,
    minLowercase: 1,
    minUppercase: 1,
    minNumbers: 1,
    minSymbols: 1
  }),
  body('userType').isIn(Object.values(UserType))
];
🏗️ System Design Concepts
1. API Design Principles
typescript
// RESTful API best practices
- Resource naming conventions
- Proper HTTP status codes
- Pagination, filtering, sorting
- Versioning strategies (/api/v1/)
- HATEOAS (Hypermedia as the Engine of Application State)
2. Database Design Patterns
typescript
// For HalalChain specific needs:
- Event Sourcing for supply chain tracking
- CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation)
- Domain-Driven Design (DDD)
- Microservices vs Monolith decision making
3. Blockchain Integration Patterns
solidity
// Web3 concepts to master:
- Smart contract interactions
- Gas optimization
- Event listening and handling
- Wallet management and security
- Private key management best practices

💡 Key Interview Questions & Answers
Technical Questions:
"How do you handle password security?"

Answer: "I use bcrypt with salt rounds 12+, never store plain text passwords, and implement account lockout policies."

"Explain JWT token flow in your application"

Answer: "Access tokens (short-lived) for API calls, refresh tokens (long-lived) stored securely in HTTP-only cookies for token rotation."

"How do you ensure API security?"

Answer: "Input validation, rate limiting, CORS configuration, Helmet.js for security headers, and proper error handling without information leakage."

System Design Questions:
"How would you scale this application?"

Answer: "Horizontal scaling with load balancers, database read replicas, Redis caching, and microservices architecture for different domains."

"Describe your database schema design"

Answer: "Normalized design for user data, embedded documents for supply chain events, proper indexing on frequently queried fields."

Blockchain-Specific Questions:
"How do you handle blockchain transactions?"

Answer: "Async processing with job queues, transaction confirmation listening, gas optimization, and proper error handling for failed transactions."
